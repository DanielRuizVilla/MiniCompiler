# MiniCompiler
Mini-Compiler for the programming language Pascal. 

The important thing is not the programming language, but it is to make a functional compiler which can detect errors as misspelled words. 

* It makes use of Flex and Bison, two tools for detect errors and make a good compiler.

Made in Murcia, May 2016.
